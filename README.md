- 👋 Hi, I’m @alantheengineer
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technical: Blockchain, AI/ML, non-linear optimisation, data driven & numerical models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about Rust, and trying to get my head around process calculus. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any blockchain project, and any innovative technology that sits at the fringes!
- 📫 You can reach me on Alan.Tominey@Gorki.network
